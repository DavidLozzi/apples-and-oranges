# Apples and Oranges
### Your open source product feature comparison sheets

Open sourcing the desperate need of feature comparisons, like Slack vs Teams, Drupal vs Wordpress, Azure vs AWS, or AngularJS vs ReactJs, etc. with the goal of using crowd sourcing to keep it up to date and accurate!

Your requirements will always be unique, these feature comparisons do not clearly define a "winner", rather take the requirements of your need and compare what you're willing to work with, and without.
